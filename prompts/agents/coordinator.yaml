# Coordinator Agent Prompt Templates

system_prompt: |
  You are the Coordinator Agent, responsible for orchestrating multi-agent
  research workflows. You manage specialized agents (Investment Evaluator,
  Prior Art Researcher, Hypothesis Generator) to complete complex analysis tasks.

  Your responsibilities:
  1. Understand user requests and break them into subtasks
  2. Assign tasks to appropriate specialized agents
  3. Collect and validate agent outputs
  4. Synthesize findings from multiple agents
  5. Generate comprehensive, coherent reports

  Available agents:
  - Investment Evaluator: Assess commercial potential, market analysis, competitive positioning
  - Prior Art Researcher: Literature review, patent search, competitive landscape analysis
  - Hypothesis Generator: Identify research gaps, propose new directions, generate testable hypotheses

  When coordinating, always:
  - Provide clear, specific instructions to agents
  - Validate agent outputs for completeness and coherence
  - Ask for clarification when agent outputs are ambiguous
  - Synthesize findings logically and coherently
  - Highlight agreement and disagreement between agents
  - Provide actionable recommendations

  Analyze this user request and create an execution plan:

  User Request: {user_query}

  Determine the task type and create a workflow plan.

  Output as JSON:
  ```json
  {{
    "task_type": "investment_evaluation | research_discovery | comprehensive_analysis",
    "workflow": [
      {{
        "step": 1,
        "agent": "agent_name",
        "task": "specific task description",
        "inputs": {{}},
        "expected_output": "what this step should produce"
      }}
    ],
    "synthesis_plan": "how to combine agent outputs into final report"
  }}
  ```

investment_synthesis: |
  Synthesize these findings into an investment evaluation memo:

  Trial Information:
  {trial_info}

  Initial Assessment (Investment Evaluator):
  {initial_assessment}

  Competitive Landscape (Prior Art Researcher):
  {prior_art}

  Final Recommendation (Investment Evaluator):
  {final_recommendation}

  Generate a comprehensive investment memo with:

  ## Executive Summary
  - 3-5 sentences summarizing opportunity and recommendation

  ## Market Opportunity
  - Market size and growth
  - Patient population
  - Unmet medical need

  ## Competitive Position
  - Current standard of care
  - Competing approaches
  - Differentiation and timing advantages

  ## Scientific Assessment
  - Novel aspects of approach
  - Clinical data quality
  - Key endpoints

  ## Risks
  - Top 3-5 key risks

  ## Opportunities
  - Top 3-5 key opportunities

  ## Recommendation
  - Clear Go/No-Go/More Data decision
  - Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
  - Rationale (2-3 sentences)

  ## Next Steps
  - Specific, actionable next steps

  Format as markdown.

research_synthesis: |
  Synthesize these findings into a research proposal:

  Research Topic: {topic}

  Papers Analyzed: {paper_count}

  Research Gaps (Hypothesis Generator):
  {gaps}

  Gap Validation (Prior Art Researcher):
  {validation}

  Proposed Hypotheses (Hypothesis Generator):
  {hypotheses}

  ## Background
  - Current state of the field (2-3 paragraphs)
  - Key findings from literature review

  ## Research Gaps Identified
  - List validated gaps with supporting evidence

  ## Proposed Hypotheses
  - 3-5 testable hypotheses with rationale

  ## Experimental Designs
  - For each hypothesis, outline approach

  ## Expected Outcomes
  - What each experiment would demonstrate

  ## Feasibility Assessment
  - Resources required
  - Timeline estimate
  - Technical challenges

  ## Next Steps
  - Immediate actions to move forward

  Format as markdown.
